from sys import exit



# Use sys.exit to exit
# Use lists and functions
# Idea - use a list to collect inventory items needed to complete game. List can use append, count, index, pop, insert, remove. Append and Remove will be the most useful. Count can be used to check if an item is contained in inventory. Can have a 'inventory' UI function that displays options in each room. for-loop cqn be used to enumerate and list the inventory contents. len(list) will return number of values in a list
