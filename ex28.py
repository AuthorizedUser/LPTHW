# Study Drills
# 1 All equality operators... ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, and, or, not, true, false, in, not in, is, is not. The in commands check if a variable is in a string, list, or tuple. The is commands checks if variables on either side of the operator point to the same object in memory.
# 2
# == Equal to
# != Not Equal to
# > Greater than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# < Less than
# <= Less than or equal to
# 3 Practiced the operators when checking my exercises (essentially did the exercise twice). Will continue to 'guess' what booleans will resolve to while coding.
# 4 Throw away paper from #3... it is in the python all-comment script with documentation on what is wrong.

# Note on on and, or statements.... python will return one of the operands when using things like "test" and "test". "False" and 1 returns false. "True" and 1 returns 1. "True or 1" gives true. False or 1 gives 1... need more research
