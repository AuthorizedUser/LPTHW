# 1 Ordinal/Cardinal - Read the wikipedia entry. Seems like a high-level language like python could use either but maintains the cardinal list format because many other programming languages use it. The main advantage of a cardinal format is that the last minus first number in the range equals the length of the range.
# 2 2010 is an ordinal year... there was no AD 0. So the entire year from start to finish is the content of year 2010... On the last day of the year we will have completed 2010 years.
# 3 Will write more lists and translate them
# 4 Check answers using python. Made a list using ordinal numbers and called their cardinal index to view them
