# plains of gorgoth - 2 infantry regiments against 2 goblin regiments
# something of a tutorial. Also includes reinforcements at endpoints
# AI - likes to continue engagement, and engage idle/defending units
# typcially not a dangerous AI
#
# mountains of gorgoth - recieve an archer 'mountain ranger' type
# unit. Ambushed by 3 enemy archer units. The archer units will
# AI goes shoot (any non-under fire units) > then
# Rain scenario
# mud scenario
# endless reinforcement 'kill the king' scenario
# surround all spearmen scenario where you have temporary
#  cavalry reinforcements
# 	but the ai keeps spearmen on constant defense > phalanx
# (When charging)
# 	forces are balanced but when an enemy unit defends you can
# free up
#   one cavalry to start routing them.
