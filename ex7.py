#Study Drills
# 1 Comments on each line
# 2 Read backwards
# 3 Note to begin writing down mistakes (will comment inline)
# 4 Try not to make same mistakes on next exercise
# 5 Remember that you make mistakes, same as programmers
# Note: Python lines greater than 80 characters are considered bad form
